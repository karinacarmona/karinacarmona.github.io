Snot Tons is meant to be a new based blog that I built for myself. I would use it to post a news topic, and then I would be able to add additional resources to that news post to back it up. Snot Tons was built in 10 hours as part of an assessment at DevBootcamp.

SnoT TonS has user authorization, and all CRUD functions for posts.

##Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript

##Challenges

I decided I wanted it to be a website with a horizontal slider layout which turned out to be quite a challenge. But the use can navigate through the site by clicking the links to scroll or click on the sides of the pages to scroll through the website.

I also implemented an interactive header, in which the blue constellations move with the mouse.
