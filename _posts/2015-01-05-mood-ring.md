Mood Ring is crowd sourced music database that will play songs based on the user's mood. A user can also add songs from Soundcloud to the music database. This final product was created in abour 3 days with a group of three other fantastic programmers. I took the role of Design Lead, making decisions on the UX/UI design of the app.


### Technologies Used
-Ruby on Rails
-Object Oriented JavaScript
-Soundcloud API
-Web Audio API
-HTML5/CSS

##Responsibilities and Contributions

Our app is deeply rooted in the principle of objected orientation specifically object orientation, specifically object oriented JavaScript. The audio controller, visualizer, slide controller, and database manager are all objects with their own functions which gave us the ability to manipulate, control, and change each of these very easily. The database manager object can pull songs from the mood playlists and 'get' songs from the soundcloud api to add into the core music database. The beautiful visualizer was implemented using the three.js library and Web Audio API. Three.js was ideal because it was an easy to understand library and it uses WebGL to render 3D interactive graphic and accelerated image rendering. As useful as three.js is, it doesn't provide any tools to interact with audio files. For that, we turned to the Web Audio API. The audio congroller can create audio objects, control it's playback, and set it's source to a soundcloud stream URL sent from the database manager. That same audio object could then be connected to a frequency analyzer provided to us from the Web Audio API to process the frequency real time. That data is fed to our visualizer and it changes the radius of the mood ring accordingly. We are able to kill two birds with one stone with the Web Audio API becuase we can control the music player and visualizer with just one audio object.
