<h2>Pairing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
    <p> I really enjoy pairing with others. I think it gives me the ability to focus my efforts and to in general focus. When someone is helping me or I'm helping someone I feel like I get a lot more out of doing the challenges. The information sticks with me a lot better. I've been struggling doing challenges at home by myself. So working with other people is much preferred.<br></p>
    <li>Was something particulary fun or rewarding?</li>
    <p> It was really rewarding when I asked for help with Ruby from my fellow cohorts and a lot of people offered to help me. And it was even more rewarding when I realized I know a lot more than I think I do.<br>
    </p>
    <li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
    <p> I get frustrated when my partner is having a hard time grasping the concepts and I have trouble helping them. I don't think I'm the most eloquent speaker. I don't really understand concept with words or definitions. Things settle in my mind as pictures of systems and not in an easily transcribable way. So when I try to help them out with their problem it's hard for me to put together the technical language.<br></p>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback</li>
    <p> I really like it. Over the past few weeks I've been readin what people say about me and have been actively trying to change the way I pair. And I especially like when people say nice things about me. *suprise*
    <br></p>
  <li> Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
    <p> Yes it helped me clearly define driver/navigator more. Which in turn helped me and my pair work more efficently<br></p>
  <li> Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to improve the next time you pair?</li>
  <p> I need to clearly define what I need help on and what I need to work on. Also I need to try to be more personal with people instead of going straight to buisness<br></p>
  <li>How was it to write feedback?<li>
    <p> I am not a good writer. Straight up. So in general it's kind of hard. But I try to stay genuine and honest.<br></p>
  <li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for you pair</li>
  <p>Definitely being constructive. I am scared of being mean or unhelpful. I just need to learn how to convey what I'm trying to say in a kind way<br></p>
