<h2>Week:1 Website Compare</h2>
<p><br>
Three websites to compare: <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>,<a href="http://www.modcloth.com">Modcloth</a>,<a href="http://www.theweek.com">The Week Magazine</a>.
Tumblr is one of my favorite sites because I probably spend the most time on it. Modcloth's design is really cute and I love shopping on it. And I always go to The Week for my random news every morning. <br><br>
On tumblr my eye is first drawn to the feed (when I log on). Modcloth draws you to the scrolling screen. And The Week draws you to their top story. Even at a distance my eye is drawn to the same place. And they do seem to be drawn to the most important area. Modcloth and The Week draw you to what they're trying to push on me. And Tumblr draws me to what I went there for in the first place.<br><br>
5 Adjectives. Tumblr: blue,simple,fun, easy, mindless. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, well-branded, organized. The Week: dated, informative, useful, organized, a lot.
Tumblr solved my boredom and keeps me on the page longer than I intend to. Modcloth solves organizing their merchandise efficiently. The Week informs and pushes important stories to the viewer.5 adjectives for the content. Tumblr: random, customized, entertaining, easy, visual. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, fun, girly. The Week: entertaining, informative, simple, engaging, smart. For Modcloth the adjectives don't vary much at all. <br><br>
On Tumblr, I'm not looking for much of anything.ON Modcloth it's really simple with thier drop down menus and quick view feature. The Week is kind of hard to navigate from another page. You need to go back to the homepage to find what you're looking for. It is so easy to browse through Tumblr's content. That's why it's so hard to leave! Modcloth is pretty easy they have easy filters to help me find what I'm looking for. The week is fun to browse through since I'm normally not looking for anything.<br>
On Tumblr I feel like I've wasted a lot of time when I'm on it. Modcloth gives me a similar feeling because I normally don't buy anything when I visit it. And The Week entertains me.
