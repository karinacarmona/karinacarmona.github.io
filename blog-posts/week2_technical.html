<h2>CSS Stuff</h2>
<p><br>I've been struggling with a lot of CSS stuff. So here's positioning. What a beast.
<br><br>
<h3> Relative</h3> <br>
This means that it is relative to itself. So if there are no other positioning attributes applied to the element (top,left,botton,right) then nothing will happen to the element. What it means that when you say 10px left. It will be 10px left of where it would NORMALLY be. Helps alterning things when they aren't lining up like you thought they would.<br> Also if there is no z-index value this element that is set ot relative will be positioned on top of all other elements.It also limites the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. <br><br>
<h3>Absolute</h3><br>
Literally means that you can place the element EXACTLY where oyu want it. This will be relative to the parent element, with no parent element the it will position itself according to the page. <br>
<h3>Fixed</h3><br>
This is relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. It's fixed and will stay right where itis when the page is scrolled.
