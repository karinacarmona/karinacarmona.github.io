<h2>JavaScript Questions</h2>
<p><br>
 <br>
 <h3>Why is Javascript popular?</h3>
 <br>When the internet was first becoming popular, the most popular broswer was Netscape Navigator. And Netscape used JavaScript for dynamic front-end web development. So if you were a web developer you had to use JavaScript to do what you gotta do. Therefore JavaScript became popular and important out of necessity and prevalence during the internet's early days. <br>
 <h3>What are great things about JavaScript</h3>
 <br> JavaScript is so open in what you can write. It will take almost anything and try to make it work. Thus it's fairly easy to use. JavaScript is straightforward in it DOM. Also, the source code is a free for all so if you want to see the way a developer did something all you have to do is right-click. <br>
 <h3>What are it's limitations?</h3>
 <br> Javascipt is so sloppy, from what I take it. The design of the language by EcMA Script is poorly written which has caused books that teach how to JavaScript poorly written. So not very many people know how to code in JavaScript efficiently. Also if wide acceptance of any code makes it hard to debug. <br><br>
