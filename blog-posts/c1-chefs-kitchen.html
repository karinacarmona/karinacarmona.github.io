  <h2> Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
<p><br>Two mindsets people in DBC get into: <br>Resturant mindset: What's on the menu? I"ll order that. Complain to waiter. Consumer mindset. DBC is a package with a price tag. Feeling "owed" the experience. We are owed the product or experience. Kitchen mindset: We're in this together. There is a sense of responisbility for the environment. You're in Creator Mode. "I'm going to blow my own mind". "I can do this" will make magic. "Please do not look at DBC as a package". Come in and make a mess. This isn't the normal kind of education. We're taught to find out what's on the test. We're taught to regurgitate. Take control of your own education! It's a long journey! DBC is there to set you on track. If something isn't working your way. Fix it! Walk in hungry!
<br><br>
Two fears.<br>  First: "I don't know that much about Ruby. My cohort is so much smarter than me. I'm gonna be the idiot in the room." Second: "I'm going to be amongst idiots." The truth is most of you don't know much about web development. And at dev we go far and fast together. Everybody has a ton to offer and a ton to learn.
<br><br>

This is exactly what I've been looking for for my education. I feel like I've ran into so many roadblocks in my education. But it's never stopped me. Only put me on a detour to a better path. In my experience, the education I've received was never right for me. The CS classes I've attended always left me wanting more and unexcited for something that excites me so much. After watching this video, I feel like I found the perfect fit. A new alternative insight on learning. I've always taken so much responsibility for my education on a logistical level and I'm excited to take responsibility for my actual education. In a format that I can really get behind. I always hated boring busy work, and doing work that never helped me after I finished. And after these last two weeks of Phase 0 I've learned probably 8 times more about myself and web development than I did in traditional schooling. I like the fight and I know DBC will put up a big one. I'm excited for everything to come. And I hope don't let my nerves get the best of me. <br><br>
