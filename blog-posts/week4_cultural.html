<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>
The tech industry is rife with sexism. It has become a very polar topic wmong people in the industry. For women in tech, it's hard to not be aware of these issues in tech.
So it's not surprising there are multitudes of amazing femininst women who are active in fighting against the male problem in tech. I have been reading many articles about sexism in tech and they always address it as a femal problem.
Granted, there still needs to be more efforts to get women interested in tech. But that won't help at all if they get spit out once they dive into the acidic rapids of the tech industry. The problem is with the existing men who think that there is no place for women in tech. Or that having a woman as a CEO is unprofessional (i.e. Tinder). 
So I personally see it as a male problem. <br><br> But wait, men don't really have to face problems wiht a lack of women in tech, right? Well, of course, it's not sexual harrassment and other serious reprecuissions. But companies who only have products made by men will be products made for men. Not to say that products made for men are exclusive and separate from products for women. But take the previous example of Tinder. A hook up app. A hook up app is virtually useless if there's no women on it. It wasn't until they put Whitney Wolfe on their team, did they actually see women stay on the app, and not get chased away from all the men. 
So yes, they do have reprecusions from the sexism they put out, and mostly from out of their pocket. Tinder is an example of why diversity is important on any product design team. The world isn't made up of only white men so neither so the tech industry or any industry for that matter.
