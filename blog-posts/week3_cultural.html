<h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
<p><br>
  My thinking style is concrete random.  through what is definted as Concrete Random which is defined as: <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
    <li>taking risks</li>
    <li>solving problems independently</li>
    <li>learns best when I'm able to compete with others</li>
    <li>likes to use trial-and-error</li>
    <li>I have difficulty with:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>restrictions and limitations</li>
      <li>routines</li>
      <li>re-doing andything once it's done</li>
      <li>keeping detailed records</li>
      <li>choosing only one answer</li>
      <li>having no options</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  I completely agree that I work waaaay better in a competitive environment. Nothing motivates me more than competition, which is hard to find in Phase 0 while I work by myself. My biggest struggle is motivating myself. I look at all the work and I don't know where to get started and I bottleneck and stop to procrastinate. I think that if I can motivate myself to just get past that and tackle problems as they come I can work through my curiculum more efficiently. <br><br>It is said that CR Thinking Style has difficulty meeting time limitiation because they can't pace themselves. Next week I need to set out a time plan and list which challenges I need to complete each day. Also pairing helps me complete challenges timely. So I need to get more into that.<br><br>A person with a growth mindset is believes there is always room for improvement and that failures are learning experiences. They believe that intelligence is not fixed or innate. They believe that with the right amount of focus any skill can be learned. For a person with a growth mindset, life isn’t about the result or the “we made it” moment; it’s about the process and “making it”. They are also more likely to be in relationships that make them better people instead of being held on a pedestal.<br><br>A person with a fixed mindset believes that their skills are innate. This causes them to always want to prove themselves. They are more interested in validating their skills in quantifiable success. <br><br>I know that anything I practice enough I will get better at. So I think that my growth mindset will help me continue and push forward even if I struggle with programming sometimes.<br>
