  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mood Ring is crowd sourced music database that will play songs based on the user’s mood. A user can also add songs from Soundcloud to the music database. This final product was created in abour 3 days with a group of three other fantastic programmers. I took the role of Design Lead, making decisions on the UX/UI design of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technologies-used&quot;&gt;Technologies Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object Oriented JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soundcloud API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Audio API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML5/CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://karinacarmona.com/images/mood-ring1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://karinacarmona.com/images/mood-ring1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contributions&quot;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app is deeply rooted in the principle of objected orientation specifically object orientation, specifically object oriented JavaScript. The audio controller, visualizer, slide controller, and database manager are all objects with their own functions which gave us the ability to manipulate, control, and change each of these very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database manager object can pull songs from the mood playlists and ‘get’ songs from the soundcloud api to add into the core music database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful visualizer was implemented using the three.js library and Web Audio API. Three.js was ideal because it was an easy to understand library and it uses WebGL to render 3D interactive graphic and accelerated image rendering. As useful as three.js is, it doesn’t provide any tools to interact with audio files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, we turned to the Web Audio API. The audio congroller can create audio objects, control it’s playback, and set it’s source to a soundcloud stream URL sent from the database manager. That same audio object could then be connected to a frequency analyzer provided to us from the Web Audio API to process the frequency real time. That data is fed to our visualizer and it changes the radius of the mood ring accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are able to kill two birds with one stone with the Web Audio API becuase we can control the music player and visualizer with just one audio object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Snot Tons is meant to be a new based blog that I built for myself. I would use it to post a news topic, and then I would be able to add additional resources to that news post to back it up. Snot Tons was built in 10 hours as part of an assessment at DevBootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SnoT TonS has user authorization, and all CRUD functions for posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technologies&quot;&gt;Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Javascript&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I wanted it to be a website with a horizontal slider layout which turned out to be quite a challenge. But the use can navigate through the site by clicking the links to scroll or click on the sides of the pages to scroll through the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also implemented an interactive header, in which the blue constellations move with the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Congratulations! You’ve been accepted into Dev Bootcamp NYC!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what to expect of this experience. All i know is that I had to go into it open minded. I was scared. I dropped out of college so I could pursue programming (a long epic about destiny). I was betting on myself and my capabilites. Hoping that I’d find something that I love and am great at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nine weeks of coding challenges at home (LA) and working 40-50 hours a week, I finally got on that plane and went to NYC to start school that Monday. That first week I spent 15 hours at school coding each day. And I wasn’t even tired, I was pumped!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev Bootcamp is split into 3 phases, each 3 weeks long, each with their own assessment to pass. In the beginning of each phase I would feel dumb and useless with all the new material, but by the second week I somehow would be grasping the material. And by “somehow” I mean hours of coding/snacking/banging my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way DBC is structured gives way to a new type of learning. One that I will carry with me forever as a programmer. And that is learning how to learn. Something I never learned in college or any earlier school. They always gave me books that had answers, tests that had questions I could google, or equations I could just throw into Wolfram Alpha. But outside of that I couldn’t learn new ideas or ways of thinking. Follow up one google search with another and another until you understand a subject fully. They never taught me the value of blog posts, following news sites that aligned with my interests, or simply the right question to put into google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had struggled with teaching myself to program for awhile before I found DBC. And I’d go on the codeacademy websites, and take the lessons I could (that were free). But that only taught me syntax “sugga” and basic algorithm solving. But what about building a website or an application?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how DBC teaches you. Set a goal. A small application and just do it. Do what you can and ask for help when you hit a roadblock. Find the right language or framework to use. Research! And doing what I love - building somehting out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DBC taught me to push myself. To not settle for just learning the syntax. To learn by doing  (funnily enough the motto of my university). I found something I love, and I won’t stop trying be better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;cite title=&quot;Plato&quot;&gt;Plato&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been away from the blogging scene for quite a while now, suddenly today it dawned upon me that I need to start writing/posting again. My writing is a little bit rusty now, and I need to brush on that. Anyways, the moment I thought about blogging, Wordpress flashed in my mind. Well, I used Wordpress &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the past and it worked well for a while, then I had to face issues like high-traffic and high CPU load and unexpected spikes in my server. Well, those weren’t too much trouble, I would avoid fixing those bugs if I was busy, and sometimes I would leave the system untouched for 2 days straight and let the server admins frown and try to mitigate the outage (I had a pretty straight forward deal with my hosting provider, that no matter what, they can’t shut down my website). The PHP runtime errors weren’t a big deal, the hundreds of thousands of SQL database queries weren’t a trouble, sometimes the site would run a tad bit slower than average, but it was OK overall for me. A sample of the emails I would receive from my hosting provider is given below:&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,


I apologize, but I was forced to suspend the script &quot;/home/hmfaysal/public_html/hmfaysal.com/index.php&quot; as it was causing a high load on the server, and due to it affecting all of the other accounts on the system, I was forced to take immediate action for the health of the server.g

I did notice that this was a Wordpress installation, and would recommend that you enable caching for it.

Please note that if you already have caching enabled, you will need to take more action such as looking into any high use modules or plugins, and seeing if there are any updates, or possibly any that you can disable to reduce the load that your site causes.

If you reply back to this with your IP address (http://www.hostgator.com/ip.shtml) we will be more than happy to go ahead enable HTTP access for you, so that you can safely work on the script without it causing further issues. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the game was changed when my site got hacked. Wordpress is notorious in getting hacked. The PHP code libraries are huge, and while Automattic tries to keep it relatively clean and bug free, bugs do persist among the thousands of lines of codes and every once in a while a bug gets discovered by the code breakers. If the bug can be exploited in some way to gain access of the site, the code breakers tend to do some serious damage. While I wasn’t been exclusively targeted by such individuals, I was part of a victimized group who used the same version of Wordpress, and all of our sites got defaced by some mass defacing software. Although it didn’t do serious damage, as I have daily off-site backup, I became dubious about the Wordpress platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this time around, while I was still brainstorming for ideas and theme designs and what not, I decided to go back to Jekyll, or you may say, rather old school. Why not use plain static HTML files with some CSS styling and JS animations? Static sites are impossible to hack, as there are no codes needed to be run on the server. The only way a static site can be compromised if the code breakers have access to your FTP account. I have used Jekyll in the past during my college years. I was working as a Teaching Assistant in the Mathematics Dept, and I was supposed to post weekly course materials on the course website. The trouble was my Alma maters IT dept didn’t allow dynamic sites to run on the nodes, and I wasn’t going download the HTML files, edit them with Sublime text, and push them back onto the server every week. So I used Jekyll and GIT Version Control to do that for me. And it was so efficient that I would post materials daily instead of weekly. It was like love on first use. But Wordpress had lots of theme choices and for my personal site I decided to use Wordpress anyways disregarding the simpleness and speed static sites provided. After the takeover of my Wordpress powered blog happened, I turned to self written PHP sites and static sites completely. I have built a social network based on PHP for my peer group which is highly secure but when it comes down to speed it lags behind. So I built this site using Jekyll, a blog aware static site generator. I hope this site will perform as envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
