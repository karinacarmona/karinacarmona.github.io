    <ol>
        <li>What is pair programming?</li>
            <p>Pair programming is supervised, collaborative programming. </p>

        <li>Why is it important?</li>
        <p>It's a sample of working as a programmer in a realistic environment.It's goog prep for phase
          one. It's an effective learning environment because you learn by teaching and from your partner.
        </p>

        <li>Compare Driver and Navigator</li>
        <p>The driver is the typist and the navigator is the person telling the driver what to type but the interaction
          is still collaborative.  The drive may give input but the navigator makes coding decisions.

  <h3>Reflections</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>Joe Zuiches:It was awesome! Over the hour we got more comfortable with the driver and navagator position.  It worked to create a basic webpage but didn't work when we both
       didn't know how to do some positioning elements.
     </li>
     <li>Karina Carmona: It was fun working with someone else on a website. I was hesitant at first because I didn't know what to expect. But we both got more comfortable and worked well together. It's nice to see where other people are in the curriculum and sharing difficulties and issues. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this.</li>
