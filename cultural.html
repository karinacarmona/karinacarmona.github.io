        <h2>Chef's Kitchen</h2>
        <p><br><h3>Two mindsets people in DBC get into:</h3> <br><br><b>Resturant mindset:</b> <br>"What's on the menu? I'll order that." Complain to waiter. It's a Consumer mindset. "DBC is a package with a price tag. Feeling "owed" the experience. We are owed the product or experience. <br><br><b>Kitchen mindset:</b><br> We're in this together. There is a sense of responsibility for the environment. You're in Creator Mode. "I'm going to blow my own mind". "I can do this" will make magic. "Please do not look at DBC as a package". Come in and make a mess. <br><br>This isn't the normal kind of education. We're taught to find out what's on the test. We're taught to regurgitate. Take control of your own education! It's a long journey! DBC is there to set you on track. If something isn't working your way. Fix it! Walk in hungry!
<br><br>
<h3>Two fears:</h3><br><br>  First: "I don't know that much about Ruby. My cohort is so much smarter than me. I'm gonna be the idiot in the room." <br><br>Second: "I'm going to be amongst idiots." The truth is most of you don't know much about web development. And at dev we go far and fast together. Everybody has a ton to offer and a ton to learn.
<br><br>

<h3>My reflection:</h3>
<br>
This is exactly what I've been looking for for my education. I feel like I've ran into so many roadblocks in my education. But it's never stopped me. Only put me on a detour to a better path. In my experience, the education I've received was never right for me. The CS classes I've attended always left me wanting more and unexcited for something that excites me so much. After watching this video, I feel like I found the perfect fit. An alternative insight on learning. I've always taken so much responsibility for my education on a logistical level and I'm excited to take responsibility for my actual education in a format that I can really get behind. I always hated boring busy work, and doing work that never helped me after I finished. And after these last two weeks of Phase 0 I've learned probably 8 times more about myself and web development than I did in traditional schooling. I like the fight and I know DBC will put up a big one. I'm excited for everything to come. And I hope don't let my nerves get the best of me. <br><br></p>

        <h2>Gregorc Thinking Style</h2>
        <p><br>
  My thinking style is concrete random.Concrete Random which is defined as: <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
    <li>taking risks</li>
    <li>solving problems independently</li>
    <li>learns best when I'm able to compete with others</li>
    <li>likes to use trial-and-error</li>
    <li>I have difficulty with:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>restrictions and limitations</li>
      <li>routines</li>
      <li>re-doing anything once it's done</li>
      <li>keeping detailed records</li>
      <li>choosing only one answer</li>
      <li>having no options</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  I completely agree that I work waaaay better in a competitive environment. Nothing motivates me more than competition, which is hard to find in Phase 0 while I work by myself. My biggest struggle is motivating myself. I look at all the work and I don't know where to start and I bottleneck and stop to procrastinate. I think that if I can motivate myself to just get past that and tackle problems as they come; I can work through my curiculum more efficiently. <br><br>It is said that CR Thinking Style has difficulty meeting time limitiation because they can't pace themselves. Next week I need to set out a time plan and list which challenges I need to complete each day. Also pairing helps me complete challenges timely. So I need to get more into that.<br><br><br>A person with a growth mindset is believes there is always room for improvement and that failures are learning experiences. They believe that intelligence is not fixed or innate. They believe that with the right amount of focus any skill can be learned. For a person with a growth mindset, life isn’t about the result or the “we made it” moment; it’s about the process and “making it”. They are also more likely to be in relationships that make them better people instead of being held on a pedestal.<br><br>A person with a fixed mindset believes that their skills are innate. This causes them to always want to prove themselves. They are more interested in validating their skills in quantifiable successes. <br><br>I know that anything I practice enough I will get better at. So I think that my growth mindset will help me continue and push forward even if I struggle with programming sometimes.<br></p>

        <h2>Diversity</h2>

 <p>The tech industry is rife with sexism. It has become a very polar topic among people in the industry. For women in tech, it's hard to not be aware of these issues in tech.
So it's not surprising there are multitudes of amazing femininst women who are active in fighting against the male problem in tech. I have been reading many articles about sexism in tech and they always address it as a female problem.
Granted, there still needs to be more efforts to get women interested in tech. But that won't help at all if they get spit out once they dive into the acidic rapids of the tech industry. The problem is with the existing men who think that there is no place for women in tech. Or that having a woman as a CEO is unprofessional (i.e. Tinder).
So I personally see it as a male problem. <br><br> But wait, men don't really face problems when there's a lack of women in tech, right? Well, of course, there's sexual harrassment and other serious reprecuissions. But companies who only have products made by men will only make products made for men. Not to say that products made for men are exclusive and separate from products for women. But take the previous example of Tinder. A hook up app. A hook up app is virtually useless if there's no women on it. It wasn't until they put Whitney Wolfe on their team, did they actually see women stay on the app, and not get chased away from all the men.
So yes, they do have reprecusions from the sexism they put out, and mostly from out of their pocket. Tinder is an example of why diversity is important on any product design team. The world isn't made up of only white men so neither should the tech industry or any industry for that matter.

        <h2>Pairing</h2>

 <p>
    <ul>
        <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
        <p> I really enjoy pairing with others. I think it gives me the ability to focus my efforts and to in general focus. When someone is helping me or I'm helping someone I feel like I get a lot more out of doing the challenges. The information sticks with me a lot better. I've been struggling doing challenges at home by myself. So working with other people is much preferred.<br></p>
        <li>Was something particulary fun or rewarding?</li>
        <p> It was really rewarding when I asked for help with Ruby from my fellow cohorts and a lot of people offered to help me. And it was even more rewarding when I realized I know a lot more than I think I do.<br>
        </p>
        <li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
        <p> I get frustrated when my partner is having a hard time grasping the concepts and I have trouble helping them. I don't think I'm the most eloquent speaker. I don't really understand concept with words or definitions. Things settle in my mind as pictures of systems and not in an easily transcribable way. So when I try to help them out with their problem it's hard for me to put together the technical language.<br></p>
    </ul>
  <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback</li>
        <p> I really like it. Over the past few weeks I've been reading what people say about me and have been actively trying to change the way I pair. And I especially like when people say nice things about me. *suprise*
        <br></p>
      <li> Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
        <p> Yes, it helped me clearly define driver/navigator more. Which in turn helped me and my pair work more efficently<br></p>
      <li> Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to improve the next time you pair?</li>
      <p> I need to clearly define what I need help on and what I need to work on. Also I need to try to be more personal with people instead of going straight to buisness<br></p>
      <li>How was it to write feedback?<li>
        <p> I am not a good writer. Straight up. So in general it's kind of hard. But I try to stay genuine and honest.<br></p>
      <li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for you pair?</li>
      <p>Definitely being constructive. I am scared of being mean or unhelpful. I just need to learn how to convey what I'm trying to say in a kind way<br></p>
    </ul>
