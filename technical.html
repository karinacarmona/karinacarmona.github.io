        <h2>Website Compare</h2>
        <p>Three websites to compare: <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>,<a href="http://www.modcloth.com">Modcloth</a>,<a href="http://www.theweek.com">The Week Magazine</a>.
Tumblr is one of my favorite sites because I probably spend the most time on it. Modcloth's design is really cute and I love shopping on it. And I always go to The Week for my random news every morning. <br><br>
On tumblr my eye is first drawn to the feed (when I log on). Modcloth draws you to the scrolling screen. And The Week draws you to their top story. Even at a distance my eye is drawn to the same place. And they do seem to be drawn to the most important area. Modcloth and The Week draw you to what they're trying to push on me. And Tumblr draws me to what I went there for in the first place.<br><br>
5 Adjectives. Tumblr: blue,simple,fun, easy, mindless. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, well-branded, organized. The Week: dated, informative, useful, organized, a lot.
Tumblr solved my boredom and keeps me on the page longer than I intend to. Modcloth solves organizing their merchandise efficiently. The Week informs and pushes important stories to the viewer.5 adjectives for the content. Tumblr: random, customized, entertaining, easy, visual. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, fun, girly. The Week: entertaining, informative, simple, engaging, smart. For Modcloth the adjectives don't vary much at all. <br><br>
On Tumblr, I'm not looking for much of anything.ON Modcloth it's really simple with thier drop down menus and quick view feature. The Week is kind of hard to navigate from another page. You need to go back to the homepage to find what you're looking for. It is so easy to browse through Tumblr's content. That's why it's so hard to leave! Modcloth is pretty easy they have easy filters to help me find what I'm looking for. The week is fun to browse through since I'm normally not looking for anything.<br>
On Tumblr I feel like I've wasted a lot of time when I'm on it. Modcloth gives me a similar feeling because I normally don't buy anything when I visit it. And The Week entertains me.</p>

        <h2>CSS Stuff</h2>
        <p><br>I've been struggling with a lot of CSS stuff. So here's positioning. What a beast.
<br><br>
<h3> Relative</h3> <br>
This means that it is relative to itself. So if there are no other positioning attributes applied to the element (top,left,bottom,right) then nothing will happen to the element. What it means that when you say 10px left. It will be 10px left of where it would NORMALLY be. Helps altering things when they aren't lining up like you thought they would.<br> Also if there is no z-index value this relative element will be positioned on top of all other elements.It also limites the scope of the absolutely positioned child elements. <br><br>
<h3>Absolute</h3><br>
Literally means that you can place the element EXACTLY where you want it. This will be relative to the parent element, with no parent element it will position itself according to the page. <br>
<h3>Fixed</h3><br>
This is relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. It's fixed and will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled through.

        <h2>JavaScript Questions</h2>
        <p><br>
 <br>
 <h3>Why is Javascript popular?</h3>
 <br>When the internet was first becoming popular, the most popular broswer was Netscape Navigator. And Netscape used JavaScript for dynamic front-end web development. So if you were a web developer you had to use JavaScript to do what you gotta do. Therefore JavaScript became popular and important out of necessity and prevalence during the internet's early days. <br>
 <h3>What are great things about JavaScript</h3>
 <br> JavaScript is so open in what you can write. It will take almost anything and try to make it work. Thus it's fairly easy to use. JavaScript is straightforward in it DOM. Also, the source code is a free for all so if you want to see the way a developer did something all you have to do is right-click. <br>
 <h3>What are it's limitations?</h3>
 <br> Javascipt is so sloppy, from what I take of it. The design of the language by EcMA Script is poorly written which has caused books that teach how to JavaScript to be poorly written. So not very many people know how to code in JavaScript efficiently. Also a wide acceptance of any code makes it hard to debug. <br><br></p>

        <h2>#map! Method</h2>

 <p>Array#map! is kind of like a loop.
It will go through each element of the array and carry out the code block that's attached to the method call. That code block should be written with the intention to output a different number than the original element in the array. #map! should be used then you want to manipulate/translate elements in an array.
