        <h2>Website Compare</h2>
        <p>Three websites to compare: <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>,<a href="http://www.modcloth.com">Modcloth</a>,<a href="http://www.theweek.com">The Week Magazine</a>.
Tumblr is one of my favorite sites because I probably spend the most time on it. Modcloth's design is really cute and I love shopping on it. And I always go to The Week for my random news every morning. <br><br>
On tumblr my eye is first drawn to the feed (when I log on). Modcloth draws you to the scrolling screen. And The Week draws you to their top story. Even at a distance my eye is drawn to the same place. And they do seem to be drawn to the most important area. Modcloth and The Week draw you to what they're trying to push on me. And Tumblr draws me to what I went there for in the first place.<br><br>
5 Adjectives. Tumblr: blue,simple,fun, easy, mindless. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, well-branded, organized. The Week: dated, informative, useful, organized, a lot.
Tumblr solved my boredom and keeps me on the page longer than I intend to. Modcloth solves organizing their merchandise efficiently. The Week informs and pushes important stories to the viewer.5 adjectives for the content. Tumblr: random, customized, entertaining, easy, visual. Modcloth: retro, cute, dainty, fun, girly. The Week: entertaining, informative, simple, engaging, smart. For Modcloth the adjectives don't vary much at all. <br><br>
On Tumblr, I'm not looking for much of anything.ON Modcloth it's really simple with thier drop down menus and quick view feature. The Week is kind of hard to navigate from another page. You need to go back to the homepage to find what you're looking for. It is so easy to browse through Tumblr's content. That's why it's so hard to leave! Modcloth is pretty easy they have easy filters to help me find what I'm looking for. The week is fun to browse through since I'm normally not looking for anything.<br>
On Tumblr I feel like I've wasted a lot of time when I'm on it. Modcloth gives me a similar feeling because I normally don't buy anything when I visit it. And The Week entertains me.</p>

        <h2>CSS Stuff</h2>
        <p><br>I've been struggling with a lot of CSS stuff. So here's positioning. What a beast.
<br><br>
<h3> Relative</h3> <br>
This means that it is relative to itself. So if there are no other positioning attributes applied to the element (top,left,bottom,right) then nothing will happen to the element. What it means that when you say 10px left. It will be 10px left of where it would NORMALLY be. Helps altering things when they aren't lining up like you thought they would.<br> Also if there is no z-index value this relative element will be positioned on top of all other elements.It also limites the scope of the absolutely positioned child elements. <br><br>
<h3>Absolute</h3><br>
Literally means that you can place the element EXACTLY where you want it. This will be relative to the parent element, with no parent element it will position itself according to the page. <br>
<h3>Fixed</h3><br>
This is relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. It's fixed and will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled through.

        <h2>JavaScript Questions</h2>
        <p><br>
 <br>
 <h3>Why is Javascript popular?</h3>
 <br>When the internet was first becoming popular, the most popular broswer was Netscape Navigator. And Netscape used JavaScript for dynamic front-end web development. So if you were a web developer you had to use JavaScript to do what you gotta do. Therefore JavaScript became popular and important out of necessity and prevalence during the internet's early days. <br>
 <h3>What are great things about JavaScript</h3>
 <br> JavaScript is so open in what you can write. It will take almost anything and try to make it work. Thus it's fairly easy to use. JavaScript is straightforward in it DOM. Also, the source code is a free for all so if you want to see the way a developer did something all you have to do is right-click. <br>
 <h3>What are it's limitations?</h3>
 <br> Javascipt is so sloppy, from what I take of it. The design of the language by EcMA Script is poorly written which has caused books that teach how to JavaScript to be poorly written. So not very many people know how to code in JavaScript efficiently. Also a wide acceptance of any code makes it hard to debug. <br><br></p>

        <h2>#map! Method</h2>

 <p>Array#map! is kind of like a loop.
It will go through each element of the array and carry out the code block that's attached to the method call. That code block should be written with the intention to output a different number than the original element in the array. #map! should be used then you want to manipulate/translate elements in an array.

        <h2>Classes</h2>

 <p>I wrote a class about the thing closest to me- paper. I created the initialize method to take the height and width as arguments. Then I gave the paper the ability to fold itself in half either with a  hotdog fold or a hamburger fold. Then I gave the user the ability to write on the paper. And it will return what is written on the given paper.

        <h2>Classes vs. Modules</h2>

 <p>Classes are collection of instance variables and methods to be used on objects in only that class. And modules are collections of functions to use across multiple classes. A module can be seen as a library you build and can access in multiple classes like Math. They are similar in that they both are created objects that are defined by the programmer. They purposes and uses are different.

        <h2>SQL</h2>

 <p>To optimize SQL queries, try these tips:
<b>1)</b> Use actual column names instead of using SELECT statements with ‘*’
<br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/y062yY2">
<br> <br>
<b>2)</b> Do not use HAVING clause. It is only for filtering rows after they’ve been selected. <br>
<img src= "http://imgur.com/KTIGtZH">
<br> <br>
<b>3)</b> Try to limit the number of sub queries in your main query. <br>
<img src="http://imgur.com/TkG4CK6">
<br><br>
<b>4)</b> Use EXISTS. IN and table joins have the slowest performance. EXISTS is efficient when most of the filter criteria is in the main query. <br>

        <h2>What is Rails?</h2>

 <p><br> <br>
Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun. <br> <br>
Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience. <br> <br>
The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles: <br> <br>
<ul>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
<li>Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
</ul>
